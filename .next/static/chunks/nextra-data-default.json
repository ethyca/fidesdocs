{"/fides/overview":{"title":"Overview","data":{"":"Fides (pronounced /fee-dhez/, from Latin: Fidēs) is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the fulfillment of data privacy requests in your runtime environment, and the enforcement of privacy regulations in your code.The Fides developer tools allow engineers and legal teams to label system privacy characteristics, orchestrate programmatic rights fulfillment, and audit stored personal identifiable information (PII) throughout application systems and infrastructure. This includes support for major privacy regulations (e.g. GDPR, CCPA and LGPD), and standards like ISO 19944 by default.","why-is-it-called-fides#Why is it called Fides?":"Fides was the goddess of trust and good faith in Roman paganism. Fides represented everything that was required for \"honor and credibility\" in every aspect of Roman life. In addition to this, Fides means \"reliability\": reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal. Fides stood out for her embodiment of this project's philosophy - to provide developers with a powerful tool to make privacy a default feature of any software.If you'd like a brief Roman mythology lesson, check out Fides on Wikipedia.","passing-objects#Passing Objects":"Since SWR 1.1.0, object-like keys will be serialized under the hood automatically.\nSay you have another function that fetches data with a user scope: fetchWithUser(api, user). You can do the following:\nconst { data: user } = useSWR(['/api/user', token], fetchWithToken)\n\n// ...and then pass it as an argument to another useSWR hook\nconst { data: orders } = useSWR(user ? ['/api/orders', user] : null, fetchWithUser)\nYou can directly pass an object as the key, and fetcher will receive that object too:\nconst { data: orders } = useSWR({ url: '/api/orders', args: user }, fetcher)\n\nIn older versions (< 1.1.0), SWR shallowly compares the arguments on every render, and triggers revalidation if any of them has changed."}},"/enterprise/test":{"title":"Test","data":{"":"Upgrade to the latest version (≥ 1.0.0) to use this feature.\n\nIn most cases, you shouldn't directly write to the cache, which might cause undefined behaviors of SWR.

Our existing tools use this language to power a low friction set of developer tools that integrate with your existing CI pipelines, making privacy a feature of your tech stack. With Fides, we hope everyone can build better tools for privacy in the next decade and beyond.","what-we-believe#What we Believe":"Data privacy is a human right that should be a native feature of any respectful technology. Today building great privacy as a feature in software is friction-filled and complicated. We're building open-source privacy tools for the developer community because we believe the only way to achieve a respectful internet is to make privacy an easy-to-implement layer of any tech stack.","the-future#The Future":"We've been working on this problem since 2018 and have a clear view of our next five years. We're excited about the roadmap of features we'll add to Fides in order to make it the comprehensive tool for addressing the major challenges of privacy in both the code management and runtime environments.We'd love you to contribute to Fides, and you can do this directly as part of the open-source community. If you're interested in solving some of the toughest and most important problems facing internet scale data-driven software, join us now and get paid to work on this problem too!","your-participation#Your Participation":"Fides' success is predicated on your participation -- Privacy as Code can only become a reality if we ensure it's easy to understand, implement, and held as an interoperable standard for wide adoption. Your feedback, contributions, and improvements are encouraged as we build community with the sole objective of creating respectful software for everyone on the internet."}},"/enterprise/heythere":{"title":"Yo yo yo","data":{"":"According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
